# Project Name: ACI-Mobile

# Project Description: 
A progressive web application I developed for the marketing department during my tenure at American Color Imaging. The goal was to be able to have a website that users could easily access on mobile so that marketing could direct people to a QR code to download at industry events and trade shows
